# In short, this program is written in Python (python3), and implements the Salsa20/8 encryption to create a keystream using bitwise operations like XOR to encrypt. The program takes 4 arguments: the key size, the key, nonce, and plaintext or cyphertext, and then is prints out the encrypted or decrypted result in hex
# To run it, I used the example that was given in the lab assignment pdf
# python3 project1.py 128 "deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef" "1234567890abcdef" "546869736973706c61696e74657874"
